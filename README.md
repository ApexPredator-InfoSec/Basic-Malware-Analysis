# Chapter Three - Basic Malware Analysis
![](Images/document.002.jpeg)

By ApexPredator
# Introduction
Malware has been around for as long as computers have been in common use. Any computer program that performs malicious activities is classified as malware. There are many types of malware ranging from sophisticated self-propagating worms, destructive logic bombs, ransomware, to harmless pranks. Everyone who regularly uses a computer will encounter malware at some point. 

This chapter will cover the basics of analyzing malware on an infected computer.  It is targeted towards beginners who are new to Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) and hobbyists. The goal of this chapter is to show someone unfamiliar with the basic concepts of malware analysis some Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used to confirm that a computer is infected with malware and how to begin extracting Indicators of Compromise (IOCs). It will cover the use of basic tools. We will not cover intermediate or advanced topics such as reverse engineering malware to discover its purpose or how it works in this chapter.

The chapter will start with a little about my background and how I got started in the DFIR field. It then covers some free tools to use in basic malware analysis. The chapter culminates with a walkthrough of a canned analysis on a piece of malware. The walkthrough wraps up with recommendations on where to go next to progress to intermediate or advanced malware analysis.
# How I Got Here
I started off working as a Systems Administrator and a Network Engineer. Most of my time was focused on Windows Active Directory networks. Over my career I shifted more and more towards a cybersecurity focus before eventually moving to full time cybersecurity. I completed a Master of Science in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance degree and a number of cybersecurity related certifications including OSCE3, OSCP, GXPN, GPEN, GWAPT, and GREM. The malware analysis portion of the job was one of the most interesting parts for me.

I had numerous instances of friends and family asking me to figure out why their computer was acting weird long before moving in to cybersecurity and receiving formal training on malware analysis. I have had other cybersecurity professionals ask why it is not a waste of time to learn to build Microsoft Office macro-based payloads when Microsoft if making it harder for users to run the malicious code inside to which I always respond with “Never under estimate the users desire and ability to download and run anything sent to them.” People are going to download and execute malware at some point and if you are the IT expert then you will be asked to figure out what happened.

One of my first instances of basic malware analysis was when I was in a situation that required using a computer shared by multiple people to access the internet. I erred on the paranoid side before using it to access any of my personal accounts and ran a network packet capture using Microsoft’s NetMon, which is a packet capture tool similar to WireShark. I noticed from the packet capture that the machine was communicating with a Chinese domain which appeared unusual. I then conducted a quick google search on the domain and found that it was associated with a piece of malware.

The site I found listed out additional IOCs which enabled me to check running processes to see that I had the malicious executable running. I was then able to kill the process with task manager. I was also able to review the registry with regedit and delete the registry key that was created by the malware to establish persistence. I was then able to notify the other users of the machine that it had malware running on it that steals information such as account credentials. The machine was then reimaged to ensure all of the malware was removed and the machine was back to a known good state. Next, we will cover some of the basic tools that you can use to perform the same type of simple analysis.
# Basic Malware Analysis Tools
This section covers free tools that can be used for basic malware analysis to identify if a machine has been infected with malware. You can use these tools to extract IOCs to share with the community or to include in an Incident Response report in a professional setting. We will start with built in tools that you probably already know and discuss how to use them for basic malware analysis.

Task Manager is a built in Windows tool that allows you to view running processes. You can use it to view running processes and how much resources they are using. On Windows 10 right click the task bar and select Task Manager from the menu to launch the Task Manager. On Windows 11 click the Windows Start Menu icon and type Task Manager to search for the Task Manager app.

You can use this tool to look for suspicious processes running on the machine. More sophisticated Malware will attempt to blend in by using the names of common legitimate programs, however, if you have a specific process name from a IOC you can easily look to see if it is running. Each process also has an arrow you can click to expand to show child processes.

![](Images/document.003.png)

`	`There are also ‘Startup’ and ‘Services’ tabs that allow you to view processes that are set to run on startup and the list of installed services. You can review the Startup tabs to help identify simple persistence mechanism of malware to see applications that run on startup that are uncommon or should not be included. This same process can be done on the Services tab to find suspicious services installed on the machine. These tabs show you the same information that you would get by running Startup Apps or services.msc independently from Task Manager.

You can pull up the details for each service listed in the services tab or from services.msc. It will show you the Startup type which is either manual, automatic, or disabled. The automatic startup type services will start automatically when the computer boots up Windows. You can also view the path to the executable that the service runs and what user or context it runs under. These details are useful IOCs for malicious services installed by malware.

![](Images/document.004.png)

Process Explorer (procexp.exe and procexp64.exe) from the Sysinternals Suite is another free tool that provides a greater level of detail than the built in Task Manager in Windows. It provides the same functionality to kill processes while showing additional details in the main window. You can submit hashes to Virus Total thru Process Explorer to help determine if a process is malicious. It also has a tab to view TCP/IP connections showing listening addresses and ports or outbound communications made by the process. The strings tab is another great feature that allows you to see the strings embedded in the binary just like the strings command in Linux. This is useful for finding IOCs and determining some of the capabilities of the malware. The Sysinternals Suite can be downloaded from <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite>.

![Graphical user interface, application

Process Hacker is another great tool that performs similar functions to Task Manager and Process Explorer. It will show you the same level or process details as Process Explorer and group the processes in a parent/child process layout like Process Explorer. Process Hacker includes a modules tab when right clicking and selecting properties on a process. This modules tab shows you all of the modules loaded and in use by the process. This is helpful for finding additional IOCs or identifying malicious dll files used by a suspicious process. Process Hacker is available for download at <https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/downloads.php>.

![Graphical user interface

Process Monitor, or Procmon, is another tool included in the Sysinternals Suite that is usefull for monitoring processes. Procmon goes beyond the process information provided by Task Manager, Process Explorer, or Process Hacker. It shows every action taken by the process allowing n-depth analysis of suspicious or malicious processes. Procmon will quickly overload an analyst with data unless filters are used to filter out the noise. It enables an analyst to find IOCs and understand what actions the malware has taken on the system.

![](Images/document.007.png)

ProcDOT is useful for filtering and displaying the results from Procmon. ProcDOT allows an analyst to ingest the logs generated from a Procmon capture saved in a CSV file. The analyst can then select the desired process from the imported CSV file and ProcDOT will generate an interactive graph. This effectively filters out the noise of unrelated processes giving the analyst an easy-to-follow graph that shows all actions conducted by the malware to include those of child processes spawned by the original process. It also allows to ingest packet captures to corollate with Procmon. ProcDOT can be downloaded from <https://www.procdot.com/downloadprocdotbinaries.htm>.

![](Images/document.008.png)

The netstat tool included in Windows is another useful tool. You can use it to view all listening ports and established connections. You can view the connections and listening ports with the command *netstat -ano*. This command includes the process ID of the process using that listed port to help you correlate a suspicious connection to a process.

![Table

The tasklist command can be used to list running process and their associated process ID from the command line. This can help you enumerate suspicious processes with out needing to use a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is helpful when used in conjunction with netstat to look up the process ID found with a suspicious network connection. The below screenshot shows that PID 4 listening on port 445 (RPC\SMB) on all interfaces (0.0.0.0) is the System process. In this case it is a legitimate process and listening port combination. The System process also always loads at PID for so if it were a PID other than 4 that would be unusual and a potential IOC.

![Table

Another way to do the same analysis is to use the TCPView tool from Sysinternals Suite. The TCPView tool provides the same information received from *netstat -ano* and *tasklist /SVC* in a convenient and easy to read GUI. This allows you to quickly identify suspicious listening ports or connections and correlate them to the corresponding process. The remote address listed in TCPView and netstat is another useful IOC to include in your analysis.

Wireshark is a valuable tool to conduct more in-depth packet analysis. Wireshark enables a malware analyst to view all network traffic sent and received on the suspected machine. An analyst can filter the packets by IP, port, protocol, or many other options. Filtering by DNS protocol enables an analyst to find DNS queries to malicious sites used for Command and Control (C2) of malware. The domains found in the DNS queries are useful IOCs to determine if the machine is compromised.

Wireshark provides capabilities to conduct more advanced analysis of malware communication. It allows an analyst to identify C2 traffic hidden in protocols such as DNS. It also enables an analyst to extract data such as second stage binaries or infected text documents downloaded by the malware. Using a proxy in combination with Wireshark enables an analyst to export the certificate and keys used to encrypt Transport Layer Security (TLS) encrypted traffic to recover the plaintext data sent between malware and attacker-controlled servers. 

The malware analysis walkthrough in this chapter will focus on using Wireshark to perform basic analysis tasks. This includes reviewing DNS queries to identify suspicious domain look ups and plaintext commands/passwords sent during malware communication. More advanced usage of Wireshark is out of scope of basic malware analysis and is saved for future writings on intermediate and advanced malware analysis. Wireshark can be downloaded from <https://www.wireshark.org/>. Microsoft’s NetMon is an alternative to Wireshark, but is only available for download from archive and is no longer being developed <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/4865>.

![](Images/document.012.png)

Regedit is another useful tool built in to Windows. Regedit gives the ability to view and edit the Windows registry. It can be used for basic malware analysis to search for persistence mechanism such as entries in HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run or HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run. Applications listed in the run keys will auto start when a user logs in to the machine and is sometimes used by malware to establish persistence.

![](Images/document.013.png)

Regshot is useful for determining what changes an application makes to the Windows registry when it is executed. Regshot allows an analyst to take a snapshot of the Windows registry before and after executing a suspicious application and generates a comparison of the two snapshots. This is useful when analyzing a suspicious application in a controlled lab setting. Regshot can be downloaded from <https://github.com/Seabreg/Regshot>.

![](Images/document.014.png)

Certutil is another tool built in to Windows that is useful for malware analysis. An analyst can use certutil to generate a hash of a file to compare it to a known malicious file hash. This can indicate if a file is malicious without having to execute it to investigate what it does. An analyst can use the hashes generated by cerutil as IOCs once a suspicious file is determined to be malicious thru analysis.

An analyst can also use automated tools for analysis. A suspicious file can be uploaded to Virus Total (<https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload>). Virus Total is an online system that will execute the file in a sandbox to attempt to determine if it is malicious or not. It will then provide file hashes and IOCs an analyst can use to identify the file. Virus Total also shares uploaded files with Antivirus vendors to use for building detection signature.
# Basic Malware Analysis Walkthrough
It is time to do a walkthrough of a sample malware analysis now that you are familiar with some of the tools used for malware analysis and their capabilities. The walkthrough will show how to use some of the tools mentioned in this chapter. It will not use any tools not previously mentioned.

In this scenario a user has reported to you that their machine has been running slow and acting “weird.” You have already conducted initial investigations by asking the user questions including: “When did the issues start?” “Did you download or install any new applications?” “Did you click any links or open any documents from untrusted sources?” The user states that they did not install any application recently but did review a Microsoft Word document sent from a customer.

We start our analysis with opening TCPView from the Sysinternals Suite to see if we can quickly spot any unusual processes communicating to remote sites. In this simple scenario we see that there is currently only one process, python.exe, communicating to a remote system.  We flag this as suspicious since python is not typically used in the manner for our fictious network. We then make a note of the port and IP for potential IOCs.

![](Images/document.015.png)

We then open up Wireshark to review a packet capture of the incident. We use the IP and port combination to filter the traffic down to the currently interesting packets. The traffic is not encrypted which will allow to view plaintext communications. We then Right click on one of the packets and select follow\TCP stream to pull up the conversation in a readable format. This shows that this is a malicious process used to create a reverse shell to the attacker. We are able to identify commands sent by the attacker and the response from the infected machine.

![](Images/document.016.png)

The attacked ran a series of command to enumerate identifying information about the machine and what privileges the user account has. The attacker then attempts to establish persistence by creating a service named “NotBackDoor” to auto start the malware containing the reverse shell. This action failed leading the attacker to then attempt persistence thru creating a run key in the system registry for the current user and was successful.

![](Images/document.017.png)

At this point we have verified that there is malware present on the system and it is actively being exploited by a remote attacker. We immediately take action to isolate the machine to cut off access from the attacker and protect the rest of the network. In this scenario we would just simply block the IP and port on the perimeter firewall and remove the infected machine from the network before continuing our analysis.

We then take steps to confirm the persistence measures taken by the attacker. We review the services in services.msc to verify that NotBackDoor service was not successfully created. Then we take a look to ensure no other unusual service exist. The NotBackDoor service name and the binPath option of “C:\Python27\python.exe C:\Windows\Tasks\bdw.py” are still noted as IOCs since the attacker did attempt to create the service and it could be present on other infected machines if access was granted.

Regedit is then used to verify the run key created after verifying that no malicious services exist. We do find a NotBackDoor key that points to “C:\Python27\python.exe C:\Windows\Tasks\bdw.py”. We make not of this as an IOC. We also note that C:\Windows\Tasks\ is commonly used as a location to drop malware due to low privilege users being able to write to the location and is common excluded from protections such as application whitelisting since it is located under C:\Windows.

![](Images/document.018.png)

The next step for this scenario is to navigate to the C:\Windows\Tasks\ folder to investigate the bdw.py file mentioned in the previous steps. The investigation shows that this is just a simple python script to establish a reverse shell from the infected computer to the attacker’s machine. We are able to see that it contains the port number 8443 but is pointing to a domain name of “maliciousdomain.cn” instead of IP. We add this domain to the list of IOCs. We could have also identified the traffic associated with this domain if we had started this investigation by looking for suspicious DNS calls. The .cn root domain indicates this is a Chinese domain and if we are in a scenario where traffic to China is abnormal then this is a potential red flag.

![](Images/document.019.png)

We know that bdw.py is malicious and provided a remote attacker access to the infected machine, but we do not yet know how it go there. We see that the document the user stated they received from a new customer ends with the extension .docm. This informs us that the document contains macros which could be the initial infection vector. Analysis on this file needs to be done in an isolated lab to prevent any reinfection.

![](Images/document.020.png)

The document in this scenario contains only one line of text stating that it is a generic document for a malware analysis walkthrough. We could look for unique strings in the document that could be used for IOCs in a real-world scenario to help others determine if they have received the same document. The next step is to check the documents for macros.

Click view in the ribbon menu at the top of the document. Then select the Macros button and click the edit button in the window that pops up. We can see that this document does contain a simple macro that uses PowerShell to download bdw.py from maliciousdomain.cn. The macro then executes bdw.py to initiate the initial reverse shell connection. The macro contains the AutoOpen and Document\_Open sub routines to run the downloader when the document is opened. We have now verified that Doc1.docm is a downloader used to infect the system with a python based reverse shell. We add Doc1.docm to our list of IOCs.

![](Images/document.021.png)

We could have started our analysis with the Doc1.docm document that was mentioned by the user. This would have given us the info to track down the reverse shell that we had found by analyzing the network traffic and processes earlier. Running Wireshark while executing the macro shows us the DNS calls to the maliciousdomain.cn. We can also extract the bdw.py from the HTTP stream since it was download unencrypted via HTTP. This can be useful in instances were more advanced malware downloads another stager and then deletes the stager from the system after running its payload.

![](Images/document.022.png)

![](Images/document.023.png)

We can also use the built in certutil.exe tool to generate hashes for the malware files to use for IOCs. Run ‘certutil -hashfile Dco1.docm SHA256’ to generate a SHA256 hash of the document. You can also generate and md5 hash and generate the hashes for the bdw.py. These are useful IOCs for signature-based systems to detect the presence of the malware.

![](Images/document.024.png)

` `We can use Procmon and ProcDOT to verify that the malicious files did not spawn any additional processes that need to be investigated. The ProcDOT graph shows us that the python.exe process communicated over TCP to IP 192.168.163.128 and spawned a cmd.exe process. We can see the commands that were run in the cmd.exe in the graph and verify that no additional files or processes were created.

![](Images/document.025.png)

We have now completed analyzing the system to verify that it is infected with malware. We determined what the malware does and we have extracted IOCs to implement in our defensive tools to detect future infection attempts. The machine will need to be reimaged before returning it to the user for use to ensure all malware has been eradicated. It is important to ensure a forensic image is taken before reimaging the system if evidence preservation is needed to legal cases or future investigations. To recap our IOCs:

- Downloader macro in document title “Doc1.docm”
- Unique string “This is a generic document for a malware analysis walkthrough” in Doc1.docm
- Second stage python reverse shell named bdw.py stored in C:\Windows\Tasks\
- Service named NotBackDoor to auto start bdw.py
- HKCU\ SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\NotBackDoor registry key to autorun bdw.py
- SHA256 hash of Doc1.docm 6fa2281fb38be1ccf006ade3bf210772821159193e38c940af4cf54fa5aaae78
- Md5 hash of Doc1.docm b85e666497ea8e8a44b87bda924c254e
- SHA256 hash of bdw.py f24721812d8ad3b72bd24792875a527740e0261c67c03fe3481be642f8a4f980
- Md5 hash of bdw.py 34ca38da117d1bb4384141e44f5502de
- Bdw.py downloaded from maliciousdomain.cn
- Bdw.py reverse shell to IP 192.168.163.128 (maliciousdomain.cn)
- Bdw.py reverse shell on port 8443

This was a simple example of how to conduct basic malware analysis. The tools ant technique discussed in this scenario can be used in a real-world scenario to determine if a machine is infected with malware and extract some IOCs. The malicious files used for this scenario and a copy of the walkthrough can be found on my GitHub (<https://github.com/ApexPredator-InfoSec/Basic-Malware-Analysis>). You will need a system with netcat to receive the reverse shell as well as fakedns (<https://github.com/SocialExploits/fakedns/blob/main/fakedns.py>) to simulate a DNS server to direct the malicousdomain.cn calls to your attacker machine.

More advanced malware will require additional tools and techniques. The techniques to reverse engineer malware to include decompiling, disassembling, and debugging is covered in course such as the SANS FOR610 Reverse Engineering Malware (<https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/reverse-engineering-malware-malware-analysis-tools-techniques/>). The FOR610 course is a good step up to the next level if you enjoyed this basic malware analysis. The course also teaches some techniques for deobfuscating code where as this basic analysis only consisted of unobfuscated code.

Additional advanced topics to look into include techniques to recover encryption keys. Those techniques are useful to unencrypt source code of encrypted malware or to help recover keys to unencrypt files that have been encrypted by ransomware. Assembly language programming familiarity is needed for debugging and reverse engineering of malware. Basic knowledge of JavaScript is also useful for analyzing web-based malware.

You can also increase your skills by taking malware development course from Sektor7 (<https://institute.sektor7.net/red-team-operator-malware-development-essentials>). Learning to develop malware will help you better understand how to detect malware and will teach you additional techniques used by modern malware. SANS also offers the advanced FOR710 course for advanced reverse engineering malware (<https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/reverse-engineering-malware-advanced-code-analysis/>).

If you enjoyed this walkthrough would like to see more you can check out my Github for a walkthrough on performing white box code analysis of a vulnerable web application and coding a full chain exploit. I have solutions for various vulnerable web applications and binary exploitation challenges and will be adding a couple of binary exploitation and reverse engineering walkthroughs in the future. I can also add in intermediate malware analysis walkthroughs if there is enough interest.
